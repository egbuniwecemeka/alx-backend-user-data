Authentication methods

Classic session-based authentication

    client                                          server
                authenticate(username/password)
request/login   ------------------------------->    credentials (validated)

When this credentials are validated, they are saved in a session object (token) which is returned in the servers response as a cookie (because the client needs to store and use this for future verifications). 

    client                                          server
                    session token
request/login   <-------------------------------    credentials (validated)

When next the client tries to connect, it uses this cookie (session token) for verification. On closing/logging off, the server destroys the session.
